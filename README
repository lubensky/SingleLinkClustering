This is a small prototype implementing single-link-clustering. 
The abstract task is to build clusters from all connected nodes in an undirected, cyclic graph. When changing the direct matches of a node, we want to detect all changes to affected clusters, e.g. added and removed nodes, created and deleted clusters.
The implementation is supposed to be as straight forward as possible, only using standard C++ features.
Also it is a playground to put some things learned in Clean Code to good use, like proper naming schemes and short, readable functions.
